1. The produce_spectrograms.m is to produce the spectrograms of hammering sounds.
2. The train_part.py is to retrain the inception-v3 model.
3. The prediction.py is for prediction.

step 1: run the produce_spectrograms.m. 
step 2: run the train_part.py to retrain the inception-v3 model.
step 3: use the prediction.py to calculate the strength of the spectrograms.
